# Web Frameworks

Currently using [React](https://reactjs.org) with [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

Might use other frameworks as [micro-frontend architecture](https://www.xenonstack.com/insights/micro-frontend-architecture#:~:text=Micro%20Frontend%20is%20a%20Microservice,top%20of%20a%20Microservice%20architecture.)
just to learn something new (Svelte, Vue)

- For Design, refer to [[Design Framework]]
- For Structure, refer to `src/` in [[Project Structure]]
- For Mobile, refer to [[Mobile Framework]]
