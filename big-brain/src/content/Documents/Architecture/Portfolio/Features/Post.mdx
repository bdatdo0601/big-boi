# Post

Initially, Post represent a Blog Post, which can be viewed in specific pages. However, I want this to be a little bit more dynamic,
accomodate various news source. Some example maybe a post fetched from Notion, a tweet, etc.

## Current Data State

Here is the old data schema

```graphql
type Post @model @key(name: "byUpdatedAt", fields: ["status", "updatedAt"], queryField: "PostByUpdatedAt")  @auth(
    rules: [
      { allow: owner, provider: userPools, operations: [read, create, update, delete] }, # owner can update, delete, and read
      { allow: private, provider: iam, operations: [read, create, update, delete] }, # iam lambda access
      { allow: public, operations: [read] } # unauthenticated users can read
    ]
  ) {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String
  status: PostStatus!
  tags: [String]
  data: AWSJSON!
  updatedAt: AWSDateTime!
  comments: [Comment] @connection(keyName: "byPost", fields: ["id"])
}

type Comment @model @key(name: "byPost", fields: ["postID", "content"]) @auth(
    rules: [
      { allow: owner, provider: userPools, operations: [read, create, update, delete] }, # owner can update, delete, and read
      { allow: private, provider: iam, operations: [read, create, update, delete] }, # iam lambda access
      { allow: public, operations: [read] } # unauthenticated users can read
    ]
  ) {
  id: ID!
  postID: ID!
  post: Post @connection(fields: ["postID"])
  content: String!
}
```

## New Requirements

- Other than our own blog post, other external source post should only have a single post state. Other state management must be owned by the source itself.
Logged in users will have the ability to delete any post
- Post renderer should render based on post type (which should make this a property at root level)

## New schema

```graphql
type Post @model @key(name: "byUpdatedAt", fields: ["status", "updatedAt"], queryField: "PostByUpdatedAt")  @auth(
    rules: [
      { allow: private, provider: userPools, operations: [read, create, update, delete] }, # owner can update, delete, and read
      { allow: private, provider: iam, operations: [read, create, update, delete] }, # iam lambda access
      { allow: public, operations: [read] } # unauthenticated users can read
    ]
  ) {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String
  status: PostStatus!
  tags: [String]
  data: AWSJSON!
  postType: String
  updatedAt: AWSDateTime!
  externalLink: String
  comments: [Comment] @connection(keyName: "byPost", fields: ["id"])
  owner: String
}

type Comment @model @key(name: "byPost", fields: ["postID", "content"]) @auth(
    rules: [
      { allow: private, provider: userPools, operations: [read, create, update, delete] }, # owner can update, delete, and read
      { allow: private, provider: iam, operations: [read, create, update, delete] }, # iam lambda access
      { allow: public, operations: [read] } # unauthenticated users can read
    ]
  ) {
  id: ID!
  postID: ID!
  post: Post @connection(fields: ["postID"])
  content: String!
  owner: String
}
```
