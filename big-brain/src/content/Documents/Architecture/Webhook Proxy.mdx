# Webhook Proxy

Services (Github, Medium, etc) generally expect server API to have no validation or handle custom validation within logic.
This forces a decisions point: whether to create a proxy that would capture these webhook or handle the custom validation ourselves if we want to keep our endpoints secure

## Solutions

### Option 1: Maker IFTTT

[IFTTT](https://maker.ifttt.com/) is a service that allows us to hook anything to anything and it consist of an endpoint that allow an unique link for different services
This allow us to manage service categorization from proxy level, while stil keep it somewhat secure (the URL should not be publicized)

```bash
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"this":[{"is":{"some":["test","data"]}}]}' https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/{event}/json/with/key/<USER-KEY>
```

### Option 2: Public Webhook Proxy through API Gateway and Lambda

IFTT unfortunately does not support passing through headers, which cause us to miss some information (particularly event type in GitHub)
