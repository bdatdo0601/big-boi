# Infomation Curator

From browsing internet, I have a lot of links that I would like to either store for future reference
or recommendation to other people. I want to have a system that allow me to automatically track all these links,
extract some metadata out of it and organize them based on custom tags

The challenge here is how to increase the ease of use. Currently here are couple of approach:

## Using the notion as the database

Notion already had a cross platform way to record information. The problem is that this will be a polling approach as opposed to real time

## Create web extension and mobile app

Probably more costly if we want to do it right (and more work too) but might be a good learning process

## Progressive Web App

Can be integrate almost anywhere. There is [Sharing API](https://web.dev/web-share-target/) as well
