## Greetings!

When I wrote [[Website Architecture]], I simply wanted to publish them in a way that would be:

1. Consistent with my code and development progress (I decided to commit them with my main codebase)
2. Make it easier to navigate around either structurely (tree-based) or associatively (graph-based)
3. Make it seamless to jot down any architecture thoughts, diagrams, etc

I did couple of deep dive to see if there is an easy way that people have done this before that fit my preferences.
Fast forward couple of weeks, while I initially expect this to be minimal size as possible, I finally found a way that
work, although it unfortunately enlarge my codebase a little bit more. Nevertheless, at the moment I am quite happy with it

## Overview

**Heavily Recommended to use Light Mode for best display of graph**

This is my documentation/research/brain-storming playground. This will be directly available on my main website as well (as an Iframem, the actual site is <http://docs.datbdo.com/>).

Below are all the tools used within here:

- [Foam Extension](https://foambubble.github.io/): VSCode/GitHub-based note taking tools with thought connection capability
- [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) with custom plugins based on [gatsby-philipps-foam-theme](https://github.com/phartenfeller/gatsby-philipps-foam-theme): To generate it into a nice static webpages that can also be searchable
- [Vercel](https://vercel.app/): Which allows me to (freely) deploy this to a public preview domains and included CICD
- Also [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) and [NameCheap](https://nc.me/) for Domain hosting and DNS mapping

## Purposes? (Don't you already have blogs?)

Not sure if I would combine the two in the future but the way I see it: Blogs would be more opinionated and experience-based while this would be more data-based and research-heavy.
This is not to say that the decision I made afterwards are not opionated, but this would just allow me to go deep into all different things and eventually connect them together
